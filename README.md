Windows-Based C++ Compiler Tool
This Windows-based C++ compiler tool serves as a lexer, tokenizer, syntax checker, and tree builder. It processes source code, providing tokens, checking expressions for syntax errors, and constructing syntax trees for analysis.

Features:
Lexer and Tokenizer: Quickly break down source code into meaningful tokens.
Syntax Checker: Verify the syntax of expressions and statements.
Syntax Tree Builder: Construct and visualize syntax trees for in-depth code analysis.
